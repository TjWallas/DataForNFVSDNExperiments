Policy requests generation program

We have considered large scaled enterprise networks where each network has 100 NFs. A chain of NFs consists of 2
to 7 NFs and the number of NFs in a policy follows a truncated power-low distribution with exponent 2, minimum 2 and maximum 7. The types of NFs in a policy are selected
randomly, with different probabilities based on how many instances of each type of NFs can be there in the enterprise. Policy requests generation program is written in c++.

Inputs to the program: number of large scaled enterprise networks (customers.txt)
Output of the program: a set of policies for each enterprise with 100 NFs
