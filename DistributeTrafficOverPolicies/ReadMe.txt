Initial traffic distribution program

We use the traffic data for each enterprise given in [2] at the starting point of the HTTP traffic breakdown, and assume it as th initial total traffic flow that will pass through all the policy chains of the enterprise. We assume that the initial total traffic load is equally distributed over the set of policies of that enterprise. The initial traffic distribution program is written in c++.

Inputs to the program: the set of policies, initial traffic load
Output of the program: distribution of the traffic load over policies
